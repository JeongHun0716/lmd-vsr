which upset some of our female residents
trapped under heavy artillery fire
courage under fire
most of his life
this is the lord ashcroft gallery
ten days beforehand
and that's all about
over the last few weeks
the following spring
here in this greenhouse and the other one
if you travel the world
i tend to use natural british stone
furniture or objects like that
it was made in germany
i would like to help
but i like to see it
we like to reminisce
for that reason
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
anything could happen
and getting rid of it
costing nearly 1 million
put it that way
everyone has gone home happy and that's what it's all about
this whole area will still be in safe hands
some 200 years later
and i suppose the bottom line is if you want a thriving
very happy indeed
i think it will
so at one point
we knew nothing about making cheese
people sat on the stairs
which is ideal for it
right on the front
twice during the first world war
in this country
she never let on
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
or have they encountered problems
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
when i see that
i made a few calls
by some miracle
the wonderful discovery of witches
we need some antiques
don't you think
while we make our way down the coastline
and our experts
don't tell anyone
and the farmers opening it up
so when the farmers come
there's more woodland
a place which is hard to live
here's some ideas
and the weather has been perfect
you've probably got yours
and it may well be
and he'd be like
this is my revenge
when he went to look for her
whatever it was
she was struggling
you think i did this
remember that man with the camera
with climate change
that's a big attraction
it's a movie theme
please welcome jenny eclair
not just in this town
to allow bad surveillance to wither on the vine
better street lighting can help
and inflammatory photograph
our continued pressure
if you don't like the slogan
the next generation
i have nothing to hide
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to abuse in the
in terms of britain
when it comes to the issue of equal marriage
we have to look at how saudi arabia
in all seriousness
about 2 million
there's a fair chance you will be
you have a problem with it
inflammatory or terrible images
to the average person
today they talked about the process of transition
the president elect has met with president obama
mr trump takes office in january
some members of the public don't quite understand leasehold
we've got a great relationship
i know it comes with planning permission
choosing a good location
if you lived in the building
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
but i think he's already learned some really important property lessons
would you want new neighbours every week or every fortnight
where is the gas
you never know by the end of the build
it's part of the national gardens scheme
but it comes and goes
this one is totally out of control
get them into the garden
learn as much as possible
keep going on about this
born into a family of dancers
he's a latin sensation
not to think for themselves
you don't need it
the president's chair
the reason being
because of the small size
something like that
with corrupt governments
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify wrongs
gardens never finish
and yet that and fish and chips
you should never be put off
there are times i like to listen to bananarama
i'm not sure what's the most difficult thing to get right
i'm still happy
it's a long way from home
this really is a tale of two cities
lots of things to think about
as you enter the rear part of the shop
and i think this is one
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get it
of course it will
it might be bonfire night
today's contestants are
and as a result
i'd like to help you
i don't want to resign
except as a last resort
i couldn't read it
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
it's almost an old person
a purification ceremony
probably in the world
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand one of these monuments in a modern
it's about the dead
i'm really looking forward to this
and this might be
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquarians
and people living
you know most of it
so i'll ask you again
then we must rescue her
before we begin
i don't believe in fairies
and on this fateful evening
what's your name
and with stealth
and you know what this means
he retrieved the flag
i'm struggling with that one
tickets for the match
an opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the armed forces
you won't have long
on this remembrance weekend
puerto rican style
it was really nice
much more driven
but he did really well
but what a surprise when you come in
because it's fantastic
he's looking to sell it
what do you think about that
that is important
stick to what you're good at
it's not as easy as it looks
it was brilliant
earlier this month
on the same proportion
thanks for watching
and i went to the museum in islington
let's put those valuations to the test
we would love to see you
he made the superstructure
but i thought it was a bit depressing
we still have hundreds of people waiting to see our experts
would you be happy
in other words made the base
they have no idea what to expect
so let's get on with it
two and a half minutes for that round
thanks for watching
they will not do
thanks for watching
manchester united fans
i wouldn't say i'm a star
thanks for watching
thanks for watching
when we see him
it's on our cable package
you want me to be happy
we are the criminals
we have no more money
not just a hotel
not just a hotel
are they relatives of yours
they would be able to go back
but the waldorf astoria
i'm not satisfied
i expected you to have a past
instead of being someone's arm candy
in the basement
but i'm not sure where
and what a privilege that is
i'm not jeremy vine
if you're watching
standing in for your regular host for one week only
that's all for this week
also known as a tandem
but my goodness
i love syllables
and more money for fifa
it'll mean more matches
what have you learned
here on the day
this is extremely rare and valuable
not for subject matter
as well as the green man
i hasten to add
we have to pay for that
get a new loyal customer and debenhams
as long as they see the spark of success
with their database
the perfect pint
without further ado
the job was done
the queen mary and the queen elizabeth
its design values
they were in the minority
500 tons of ocean liner
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
will appear in court next month
and you and him
it seemed to be
this is all you
i do miss it a little bit
and you know that
on international women's day
that was beautiful
and it's the one that
the duke of gloucester
and went on the ordinary wing
and i really hope
it's all about myth making
as the morning spread upon the mountains
come to my room
the great thing about the railways is
provided by the railways
very attractive young woman
again open to the elements
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
and that had an important effect
fame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being challenged
there's no wrong way
but ten years ago
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of war
one was a pilot
where i'm going
celebrating 100 years of war films
surrender was not an option
this is one of the questions
i'm terribly sorry
he died that very first day
join me tomorrow
came up with the perfect name
while we've been away
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
it really was that bad
you've had a tough day
protected from the prevailing winds
just like any good comic book villain
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
after just a couple of days
but since jack's first discovery
we know what they are
and then of course
there's no obvious reason
searching for answers
and things like that
you have to go and buy biscuits
they all came and went
it didn't survive
you're wasting your time
it's here to stay
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've heard
and it's all about the context
you're all the same
we may enjoy the thrill of more regular sightings
we don't have brown bear
if the answer is no
i had no idea how much
at the same time
that's why i'm losing my voice
how great is this
before i announce the winner
i need to get to work
very few remain
and it is a service
i like spending time with him
that's a shocking percentage
children and adults alike
giving hope and care to others is something our armed forces do without question
to have no contact at all
we heard the story of the nurse anna cross
back in sierra leone
and this wasn't unusual
as well as the body
we had a blazing row
that was some time ago
when you're away from it
the job description of a farmer's wife
the day to day lives of tenants
we were flabbergasted
it's a tremendous responsibility
we will own it together
it will be a great investment
pretty on the outside
or properties should i say
i would market that
ground floor flat
very close by the university
because it was offices
thank you very much
how does it work
we still have all of this to come
all of that could change
but what exactly is it
everyone was blown away
rescuing a damsel in distress
i want to take a selfie
that's it for the reds
just before christmas
i think she's completely bonkers
thank you very much
but it might be too late by then
from what we know
i don't think so
because the empire
would not be a happy place
and would eventually marry her after his wife
with that flourish
depended on trade
serbia is pandemonium let loose
which is absolutely understandable
there are no recordings of lloyd george at the peak of his powers
the most energetic people in
which was the mass newspaper
my great great grandfather
the very best talents
he hoped to return to power
what you need to do is get the very best brains
and he was very devoted to his children
it's often forgotten
very fine indeed
i think it's brilliant
a tribal nation
mr khan speaking
i don't really want to go
if we have learned one thing over the past year
rising above it
the olympic swimmer
why don't we all just get along
i wish i was more like you
louise and kevin
what their aspirations are
without the dialogue
also very good for any strains
ready to go racing
a very popular tourist destination
what do you think
for the most part
the price of property
on the other hand
i can't put it any plainer than that
which is relatively small by scottish standards
and this is very important
i know how hard you work
i can't take much more of this
we need to be a team
she informed me
you're an idiot
i honestly don't know what to do
right in front of me
we talked about it
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them team pocket rocket for nothing
for the audience at home
that was within budget
the rise of may
that's why i get up in the morning
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
this is the best bat hotel in town
the day just got weirder and weirder
the bat benefits
how does the plant attract the bat
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
a revolution is taking place
it can be quite daunting
over the next few weeks
for whatever reason
without my sunglasses
someone came out of a neighbouring property and said
very expensive shed
even the foreplay
and it might seem ridiculous
staggering on the edge of space
that's not right
in this universe
the forces of nature separate out
stretching back 3
12 miles in diameter
neutrons and electrons
we live in a tiny
pondering the immensity
but when you open the box
the work was hard
the operation would go ahead
not part of our glory
or whatever it was
but you don't need to worry
the experts don't know what caused it
the father died five years ago
with white christmas
everyone on the show really
this could be a first class routine
so please welcome
because of the demand of the market
that's my kind of location
sometimes it's difficult to know where
it seems a very good location
it might be viable
if you intend to bid on a place
it's hard to come away from it
most of the recovered pieces were lost
let's go inside
very soon after taking off
that was going to be my next assumption
that was exciting
anything can happen
i don't think so
i'm absolutely in love with this
for something completely different
flowers and even vegetables
when it comes to publicity
i'm just saying that denise brought me up
we had no money
when you came back
i'm not having a go at you
i'm sorry that doesn't meet with your approval
it may take some time
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
including a baby
you're wasting your time
add another ten on
but in this case
one bedroom apartments around here at the moment
realistic value wise
for this property
probably around 85
and since the conversion
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere above us
but despite all this
one male official commented
they carried on competing
25 years to complete
because there was no role model
she will be very pleased
but despite all this
if you want to experience some of that
enjoy the money
embossed leather wallpaper
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk of the job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm back
some decent scores
thanks for watching
so let's find out who that will be
when my husband and i are not around
it's just a wee village
some you have to book
the fishing villages on the northeast coast
pleased with himself
that's what you said
so i don't know
it's just a name
you don't deserve my grace
it was a blank canvas
in the first year alone
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
which is now in syria
for the first time
taking it all in
he ordered them back inside
one northern welsh ruler
tearing it to the ground
as she lay dying
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
taking no chances
and when you're moving through enemy territory
according to legend
and here on top of the eagle tower
according to legend
there was a portcullis
formally acknowledged his title as the prince of wales
that i'll be ok
you better stay well away from me
but i promise you
have you got it
we have the delectable neil jones
but don't worry
he moved around a lot
there's always historical treasures to look at
and later in turn
later on in life
as is the title of this poem
fast and furious
it's a wonderful
we might find some maritime memorabilia
i need to close the restaurant
and the top end of 15 to 18
because i must say
end of november
garage and techno funk
look at me at all
it's still going up
i would say probably about 25
with the price of gold
free range good
as long as you're calm
to make it work
why are many supermarkets stopping selling caged eggs
is it all good news
all in the glare of the spotlight
two minutes on general knowledge
thanks for watching
and you can follow us on twitter
that's according to the police watchdog
we have all the usual suspects
so ten cubic metres
anywhere in the world
i just collapsed
demonstrates the value of green space
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please donate now
for a brief time
we worked together when we were starting out
i don't want to
it is a battle that needs to be fought
on the second floor
it's very clean
if you can't go up
the appliances have been done nicely
this auction lot has it in spades
it's cosmetically improved quite drastically here
it could be your passport to a small fortune
and things like that we'll do ourselves
squirrel pox virus
causes it no harm
but not for me as a farmer
but now we have these viruses
it's that simple
i can't believe it
but before that
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
i want to talk about daddy too
but it's not all bad news
i do know what it means
after all i've been through
when i found out
sort of second half of october
and if you want wonderful
when there isn't much else in the garden
we can just about get away with it now
it's not all about size
well into november
starting with the compost
something like a garden compost
there is one thing
it might be conceptual
it's like looking at art
thanks for watching
you must have a personal key
and we run love
how do i choose this
a striking contrast
we've got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserve
a new chance at life
i don't really mind
being on my own
i don't remember that happening before
it's an amazing place
but that's all changing
i just can't seem to win
i'm your simon cowell
for some reason
thanks for watching
that's what i am
it sounds very good
she's depressed about daddy
now you listen to me
we don't clip it for the money
goes out the other
could we arrange that
i was fine yesterday
now they are gathering
all life in the arctic
and it was built totally by public subscription
very heavily taxed
and the scottish customers to buy
but at the same time
and it was totally normal
if i didn't have her
all my fingers were hanging off
that sounds like a pretty crazy job for anyone to be doing
he was shot and killed
i went to use my right arm
cheat and steal from one another to get themselves a decent meal
in this case a flower
but there's a problem
as animals are preparing for the winter
let's not mess about
what i can tell you
today almost 50
the government looks set to win
there was a stone circle here
no one would look twice
judging by what i saw today
just between you and me
thanks for watching
and you can follow us
what did you put in the mulled wine
it's a terrible idea
in the long term
and in the process of me not offending god
because the whole point of 9 11 is that it's the justification for the police state
i don't care what the cost is
she's got the best top line in the business
this is a semifinal
which explains it
it's the internet
i'm with mark twain lies
and i'm warning you
usually a bicycle
or is it that you enjoy those toys and it makes you into a different person
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your doll
the ball shaped one
space was still the final frontier
stick some james bond on
so what he did to get round that
you see that present
i think he's perfect
already in the states
on the orders of queen victoria
every year since christmas began
you can't really say
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bacon
i actually wanted to be a horse
in victorian britain
way back in the early
four little turtles named after italian renaissance artists
some burn brightly for a year or two
that someone was going to get
but in those days
it looks really like it is
when it comes to toys
you want to look
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
it becomes a fire engine
maybe not uranium
when i get home
at the same time
the right place
through the accessibility to those children
what was all that about
you unfold the board
they were innocent and charming
if you didn't have one
not in front of the whole family
the armed forces
that knock on the door is a moment they will never forget
killing him and five friends
as we approach remembrance sunday
i've been involved with the military
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station
who was killed in afghanistan
very similar to fishing
he's my builder
we played in a band together
please don't try to vote if you're watching on demand
tension and emotion
can they improve on that score and possibly run away with the trophy
so please welcome
it was actually extremely well placed
and it's perfect for tonight
and turning upstairs into an open plan area is definitely the way to go
that's very bad news
that's an option
fabulous project for them
will it be above par
and that's really well done
travel three miles further west and you do get more for your money
it takes hard work
will it be a fun
if that was fitted out
all the information will be there
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
two appointments later
the man who cares about animals
child of the millennium
the first and second floor flats
the best bargains
not quite as high
it's a plus point
on the face of it
thanks for watching
thanks for watching
i just got back
finding the right path is not always easy
during the summer months
that is a sold sound
there's plenty to indulge in
everywhere you go around here
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
what do you think
we have gone digital
it's time to return to wolverhampton
this is where the surprises happen
they decided to tie the knot
this is south well
when he was staying at the palace
to say to the king
the romans felt their presence was strong enough here
thousands of pounds
that's not an ancient roman mask
that was fast and furious
having said that
which a lot of them were
done and dusted
he's japanese made
our journey isn't over yet
i will always need you
i feel guilty when i'm at home
it'll be a brilliant success
to see these animals
to speed things up
no food left out
i'll meet you at the party
that is a first
but there was even better news
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
he was about to find out
represented by this bunch of bananas
it's down to our brain getting things wrong
i'm getting older
i'll be popping in each evening
across 95 miles
a floating hotel
where are the maldives
they haven't gone far
harold in neighbours
time now for one of the greatest tv comebacks of our time
we need to start layering
i'm really sorry
i want to be in the holding company
and for that reason
once those lift doors open
to the potential investor
i know it quite well
good luck to him and the elusive michael beckett in their new dragon partnership
whatever they decide to call the company
just like my personality
in the form of a dessert plate
in a modern house
that makes a grand total of six
regarding one of britain's most noted
but she's not confused
you need to be strong up here
make sure you never get depressed again
with billy not being yours
the way the market is
as a result of the gunpowder plot
all hoping the king would fall
these laws would remain in place for over 200 years
the ringleader of the gunpowder plot
think about the melting sea ice
maybe more of steel and iron
literally two minutes from the airport
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
which melts more ice
and with that in mind
not just here in nottinghamshire
it's time to find out if nigel
his father died
but it seems the pendant is to everyone's personal taste
let's take a look behind the scenes at how it all came
time now for our next guest
over the last 12 years
as you might say
before we go any further
men want to be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
with family and friends
it's all about the strictly pro challenge
so wonderful to see that
we need to do something bigger
trying to bring them down over the centuries
i've been waxed
talk about smart
who doesn't have vision
so rather than just relying on this information
all of the brain is combining all the different senses
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to do
with one of the rooms upstairs
it can be quite expensive
before we all get too excited about that prospect
some issues with potential damp
it's a multicultural
which is only 10 minutes away
a great place for him to be
this is a sweet
on the face of it
and you've got every right to be
if it was going to be increased
if you are looking round auction properties before the auction
a one bedroom first floor flat
did they get it done on time and for the right money
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
get down to your local one
some got what they want
there is no air so there is no sound
so from his vantage point
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
how can i do that
destroying the property
what was it that made you think
purely by chance
i shouldn't say those things
guess what i'm talking about right now
for me it doesn't make sense
if we have a belief in reincarnation
there are a lot of people
the average cost of keeping a person in prison is 36
my first granddaughter
even though her father at that time disagreed
around the world
but i come across training prisons now
non violent offences
talking about this
so when the body is brought back
the cost of this failure
thanks for watching
i hadn't thought that
and she was being interviewed by the american journalists
so what did you do before
that would be fantastic
but you have to go
in all seriousness
we did a different version of things and then
that's what they do
and then turned to me and said
played by jim broadbent
every two weeks
i do nothing wrong
this house will just come together and flourish
but before i do
what season was that
there is a huge crossover between the two
i feel like this
islam allows polygamy
i do hope you'll join us then
because that's how you are a part of society
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wing propaganda
formerly known as simon
they are children
or more correctly councils
before i came out
especially as it relates to children
tax credits are basically benefits
if you can have sex
how big is that
coming in on the other side
separated from that
with strong winds
if it gives me some sort of control back
that's the message from independent economists after the chancellor's autumn statement
with my blessing
about 20 years ago
taking horticulture to the extreme
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
but now there's more protection
enjoy the summer
and a couple of weeks ago
like hundreds of thousands of people do every year
the main concern
there was a boy
human representations can be offensive to muslims
you don't have to be a celebrity
proper street food is great
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
the guilt would go
but he wouldn't listen
i don't think so
like many others
only seven places remain
great leonard cohen
it separates yorkshire from lincolnshire
hoping to make a fortune at auction
after having spent ten years himself in exile
which the norwegian government was supporting
thanks for watching
it's not a career
although i can't imagine why
because i just want to help
and let's face it
project management is really my specialist area
to be completely honest
you really feel a part of it
in the eyes of some
rommel was falling back
awaiting court martial
if you've got a question for either of them
before we bring on our next contender
so to do ballroom
any man would be proud to have you as a son
at the end of the day
it's become so fragmented
i am the ultimate power
they get lost on the way home
it's all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you look inside
asking for permission
and your family and your kids and your other jobs
which was quite amusing
if they start from here
when i was a kid
that was amazing
let's say for example
very high level
people are happy to be there and it's a good vibe
you go to bed with it
obsessed with this show
that's a pickled walnut
go about telling him that
just working with him every week is such a treat
because they've got to
if you go wrong
for good reasons and bad reasons
the longer you stay in
if i had my way
because you work so hard
so when he gets grumpy it's like
i'm sure you can imagine
everywhere you turn
going all over the world
before you know it
if we have a little argument
she is hysterical
i don't mind this one
and i do mean hundreds
which is incredible
i really appreciate it
it won't take a moment
which is a shame
so what is the etiquette
we want to know what you think
and on sunday at 12
george skinner is with me
what's the best thing about the royal highland show
there is so much on over the weekend
where's the horns
i can't believe
you are out of it
i've got a better idea
i love weddings
why don't we all object
no longer dependent on the sun
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
and we have today
and they don't make big money
everywhere you look
you've really made my day
and i'm pretty sure his push bike came in very handy
they were so inspired by it
check the details on our website
why show me this
the six highest scoring runners up will qualify
thanks for watching
the rochelle to my marvin
i guess i'm afraid
she's my juliet
that's what child support services does
nicola is definitely the love of my life
welcome to the tower
was it your choice
run for cover if you can
and after reaching out to him on the show
with that in mind
they are under a lot of stress
i feel rather embarrassed
if we don't like it
heston is here to help you
something is going to work out for me
it could end tonight
things like this became very
the quality of that sliding across
a rather special
and that's what it's all about
we found out about the suffolk punch horses
but it's a different type of animal i want to show you right now
you should think about it
good luck with that
join us next time for many more surprises
until next time
they were friends
i just love that
tell me about it
we need to find out is there a problem
so you know who he really is
the perfect family
the perfect house
and it's a beautiful place as well
he still wanted
i really miss the island
from time to time
we both want to be here
regardless of what happens
doesn't mean to say that we get on with everybody
but i felt he was exposed
it is the quarter finals
my little boy is
even christmas day
i'm on the case
i pay the money
over the course of his life
when it's finished
see how much it comes to
best and happiest of all
what else can i be
she is married now
not well dressed
the time before him was his own
this really makes us think
maybe there's an extensive pattern
i'm trying not to get carried away
when the archaeologists got to work
even before she entered the water
she was a flawed ship
is it true she was
from small ships
visiting almost all parts of the empire
it's not the middle ages
the first muslim woman to serve as a cabinet minister
he doesn't own me
so you should be
that first meeting
but another striking union
it's higher than before
i have had my fitting now
between them now
it was full of content
it's actually a salsa
you are dynamic
as i was saying
don't you agree
the family seat
when he retired
some people here tonight prefer subtitles
if you haven't caught it yet
surely as a matter of principle
standard rates apply
herself currently learning to sign
hasn't time flown
if you're watching
in the meantime
he made a move on me
we've not discussed it
that's very good
stocks and shares
it sounds wrong
she's pushed herself
it's a baking show
and then when it came to his signature
so in the meantime
in the highway code itself
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
and i feel very
through antibody directed therapy
here to give us a rundown of the greatest facial choreography ever seen on the box
face to really tell the story
if you want to know what the kids are listening to these days
louise and kevin
get yourself over here because first up tonight
and it's not just any old tuesday
who knew that one man
no more suicide bombers
and the next day
they're moving around
and we were right
and for me the surprise was
the rivalry and all that
every week he comes out
but it was so disconcertingly calm in the studio
but towards the end
he has not held back anything
here to reveal the secret to getting your hands on the trophy
that's good news
the most famous of them all have to be the works of the bronte sisters
in terms of fire service resources
have you ordered yours yet
that's not what i was expecting at all
rather than using drugs
the big question is
but these are one of the most wary birds in the world
is in the drying
the man takes the lead
up until last week
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
it's time now for everything in between
but i couldn't believe it would be true
it's all about rarity
as opposed to chinese
and the man who made the discovery
if you've got a good story
graham baron ash
and they were the first people
and the champagne
i probably would
with people without creating
with other people
that's really sad
and the initials stand for the international marxist group
this came from the big
as you may know
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
you have to hold your nerve
i'm right in saying that
what do you know about it
i think something drastic needs to be done
it certainly won't be
time has passed
we don't want to spend more than
who's very much into family history
if you build it
that's the holy grail
been intensely sad
and the second generation
it was a brutal experience
they kept living
set up by the government
many people did slip and fall and break a leg
and all the survivors of the holocaust
in exact detail
and in the morning
cracks will appear
let's just calm down
when it comes to designing fabulous costumes
they are battling to be crowned pro challenge champion
and it's a great way to eat it
that's quite a large leaf
eight feet tall
it may be a miniature compared to that
i can plant them in that spot
sometimes it doesn't
wherever you are
i think it looks great
and the reason for that
a little saxifrage
the shot of musket
he was halfway there
then the invitation
there was a glimmer of hope
to divide the room into two parts
part two is the declaration of rights
more open minded perhaps
i love this name
and more open to the parliament
which of course
it makes them sound like an action film
it was the battle of the boyne
they say that the king may not raise taxation without the consent of parliament
leave that to me
but for all that
don't forget me
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blueprint
he was so popular
these are my words
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
the prime minister slaps him down
every single person
i had a great time
that's the best kind of teaching
thanks for watching
don't forget that scarecrow
maybe to somewhere nice and safe
and it's a strange
so it's an inspiration
while i'm surrounded by water right now
there aren't any biscuits in that barrel
when my father died
that would just make things worse
i didn't mean you
for the next two minutes
rightly or wrongly
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
it's not a massive sum of money
they love architecture
learning the ropes
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the press
going under the hammer right now
